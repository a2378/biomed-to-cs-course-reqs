#+title: Comparing BME to CS course requirements
#+options: num:nil toc:nil

* What CS topics are missing?
- Algorithms
- Automata theory
- Proofs
- Compilers (not required but I want to cover this)

* What CS topics have been covered?
- Everything else

* How to fill in?
- MIT OpenCourseware 6.006 Algorithms,
  Algorithms textbook by CLRS
- MIT OpenCourseware 6.045J Automata, Computability, and Complexity,
  Introduction to Automata Theory by Hopcroft and Ullman
- MIT Opencourseware 6.042J Mathematics For Computer Science,
  How to Prove it by Velleman
- MIT OCW 6.004 Computation structures,
  Dragon book
- Then take algorithms, PL (for automata), complexity theory, compilers classes
  after starting
